    "Goal: retrieve all opinions written by the Supreme Court for a specified year range.\n",
    "\n",
    "SCOTUS denies thousands of cases every year, and each denial gets its own document, so we can't just grab all SCOTUS documents from CAP for a specified year. We need docket numbers for the cases that granted cert and argued before the court. Here, we source those docket numbers from the [Super-SCOTUS dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/POWQIT) [[paper](https://aclanthology.org/2023.nllp-1.20/)].\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get docket numbers for the years 1986-2019 from superscotus.\n",
    "2. For each year, request a small sample (~15) cases from CAP. (waiting on unmetered API access before pulling full set)\n",

    "**Case issues**\n",
    "- [Board of Education v. Tom F.](https://cite.case.law/us/552/1/) Here, there was a recusal, and the court split 4-4, leading to a ~2-sentence per curiam opinion saying the lower court was affirmed by default. For some reason, you can't search for this case by docket number (via web or API)\n",
    "- [Altantic Sounding Co. v. Townsend](https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/): Classified as 11th circuit instead of SCOTUS, so 9009 court filter returns 0 results with this case's docket number"
